# A cross‑platform mobile learning platform delivering gamified attention‑training exercises for children aged 5‑10 with ADHD/ASD. - Active Development Plan

> This checklist is used by AI coding agents to track progress. Update checkbox states as work is completed.

## Establish Infrastructure & COPPA Compliance
• Set up AWS environment (Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB)
• Initialize Flutter project
• Draft the COPPA‑compliant Privacy Policy
• Implement functional login/signup with a Parental Gate

- [ ] Provision AWS infrastructure with IaC (Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB) - Create Terraform scripts that provision a Cognito user pool, IAM roles, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB tables. Verify resources can be created, destroyed, and accessed via the CI pipeline.
- [ ] Initialize Flutter repo and configure CI/CD pipeline for builds - Generate a new Flutter project with core folder layout, add pubspec dependencies, and set up a GitHub Actions workflow that runs flutter analyze, unit tests, and builds APK/IPA on each push. Ensure the pipeline passes.
- [ ] Draft and approve COPPA‑compliant Privacy Policy and Terms of Service - Write a privacy policy and terms of service that satisfy COPPA requirements on data collection, parental consent, and retention. Store the documents in the repo and obtain a sign‑off checklist from a legal advisor.
- [ ] Implement parental gate login flow with Cognito and Lambda backend - Develop a parental gate UI where parents sign up via Cognito, verify email, then create a child profile behind the gate. Connect to a Python Lambda that validates age and returns a token. Test end‑to‑end on an Android emulator.

## Develop Core Gamified Exercises
• Develop 5 core attention games using Flutter Flame or simple animations
• Implement Python Lambda functions to calculate Attention Scores from game telemetry
• Create a playable loop where a child finishes a game and data is stored
• Include reward mechanics (Star Store) for engagement

- [ ] Tasks to be defined

## Implement Parent Dashboard & Subscription System
• Build the Parent Dashboard UI
• Integrate Stripe or RevenueCat for $9.99 subscription purchases
• Set up automated weekly PDF reports via AWS SES
• Enable parents to view Attention Score, Consistency Tracker, and payment status

- [ ] Tasks to be defined

## Finalize QA, Optimize, and Submit to App Stores
• Conduct beta testing with 5–10 parents (TestFlight or similar)
• Fix UI bugs and optimize loading times
• Prepare and submit the app to Apple App Store and Google Play Store
• Allow 3–5 days for review and address any store feedback

- [ ] Tasks to be defined
