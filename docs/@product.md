# FocusPlay – Gamified Attention Training for Kids

## Product Overview
FocusPlay is a cross‑platform mobile app that delivers a library of adaptive, gamified attention‑training exercises designed for children ages 5‑10 with ADHD or ASD. Parents subscribe for $9.99 / month to access personalized progress analytics and receive reminders that help children build sustained focus in a fun, COPPA‑compliant environment.

## Vision & North Star
**Vision:** Empower children with attention challenges to improve focus through engaging, evidence‑based games, while giving parents clear, data‑driven insight into progress.  
**North Star Metric:** Average weekly active minutes per child × 30‑day retention rate ≥ 80 % within the first 6 months of launch.

## Target Users

| Persona | Description | Primary Needs |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Parent‑Pat** | 35‑45 y, primary caregiver, tech‑savvy, seeks tools to support a child with ADHD/ASD. Lives in North America, comfortable with monthly subscriptions. | Easy onboarding, clear progress reports, safe environment, reliable reminders. |
| **Child‑Charlie** | 6‑9 y, diagnosed with ADHD/ASD, short attention span, loves interactive games and visual feedback. | Short, engaging sessions, immediate rewards, age‑appropriate difficulty scaling. |
| **School‑Admin Sam** (secondary) | Director of a special‑needs program, evaluates tools for classroom use. | Ability to view aggregated class metrics, bulk licensing options (future phase). |

## Core Goals
1. Deliver an MVP with 10‑15 adaptive attention games within 1 month.  
2. Achieve COPPA‑compliant onboarding and authentication flow.  
3. Launch the app in the North American iOS and Android markets.  
4. Secure at least 200 paying parent subscriptions in the first 3 months.  
5. Maintain a subscription price of $9.99 / month with seamless in‑app purchase handling.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **COPPA‑Compliant Onboarding** | Age verification, parental consent UI, and secure data handling per COPPA/GDPR. |
| **Child Profile & Baseline Metrics** | Capture initial attention baseline (e.g., reaction time, session length) and store per‑child data in DynamoDB. |
| **Adaptive Game Library** | 10‑15 short (2‑5 min) games that adjust difficulty based on real‑time performance metrics. |
| **Gamified Reward System** | Points, badges, and virtual stickers that unlock new game themes, encouraging repeat use. |
| **Parent Dashboard** | Visual analytics (daily/weekly trends, heatmaps) and exportable PDF reports. |
| **Push Notifications & Reminders** | Configurable daily session reminders and milestone alerts via Firebase Cloud Messaging (integrated with AWS SNS). |
| **In‑App Subscription Management** | Apple App Store & Google Play billing integration, auto‑renewal handling, and cancellation flow. |
| **AWS Backend** | Cognito for authentication, Lambda (Python) for business logic, DynamoDB for scalable NoSQL storage; optional RDS (SQL) for reporting aggregates. |
| **Analytics & Crash Reporting** | Integration with Amazon Pinpoint and Sentry for usage insights and stability monitoring. |
| **Accessibility Settings** | Text‑to‑speech, high‑contrast mode, and adjustable audio levels to accommodate diverse needs. |

## Constraints & Considerations
- **Timeline:** All MVP features must be production‑ready within 4 weeks. Prioritize core games and onboarding; defer advanced analytics to post‑MVP sprints.  
- **Cross‑Platform:** Use Flutter to share UI code across iOS and Android, reducing development time.  
- **Compliance:** Implement COPPA consent flow, store personal data in encrypted DynamoDB, and ensure no third‑party tracking without parental approval.  
- **Scalability:** Design Lambda functions to be stateless; use API Gateway throttling limits appropriate for early‑stage traffic.  
- **Monetization:** Subscription price fixed at $9.99 / month; handle regional tax compliance (e.g., sales tax in US states).  
- **Localization:** MVP language is English only; plan for future i18n after North America launch.  
- **Data Privacy:** No collection of location or device identifiers beyond what is required for push notifications.  
- **Testing:** Include unit tests for game logic, integration tests for authentication flow, and UI tests on both platforms before release.
