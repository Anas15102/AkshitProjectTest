## Tech Stack


## How You Must Work

### Before Starting Any Task
1. READ `.context-pack/@active-plan.md` — this is your task list
2. VERIFY the task exists in the plan before working on it
3. Only work on listed tasks — do not invent new scope
4. If something critical is missing, add it to the plan first

### While Working
- Follow patterns in `.context-pack/@tech-spec.md`
- Reference `.context-pack/@product.md` for product context

### After Completing a Task
- Update `@active-plan.md`: mark tasks `[x]` complete
- Add notes if implementation differed from plan
- If MCP connected: call `push_progress_update`

### When Blocked
- Record blocker in `@active-plan.md` — do not silently skip

## Documentation
- `.context-pack/@product.md` - Product spec
